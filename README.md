![Installation](installation.drawio.png)

Basics of the design figured out. Ideally:

- An image of the arcade space can be used as a background image for the site
- The game cabinets themselves can be hovered over and clicked on to bring up the different site locations

Locations needed:
- An "about" page
- A list of available games that includes:
  - game specs
  - full CRUD for managing games (Authentication?)
- link to Ebay(?)
- link to existing message board/reddit

------

Alternative style (may make more sense actually):
Have all the above functionality housed within a controller above the image
Have all the cabinets clickable, but only bringing up specs for that game individually

This would allow for "list of games" to become far more robust and not limited to availability
