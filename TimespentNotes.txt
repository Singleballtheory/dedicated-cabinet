12/3 End of day notes -- Had a bit of a hickup with the friend I'm building this for. He wasn't available this afternoon to go over thoughts/ideas/desires for the site so I've more or less just been watching videos and looking stuff up. I found a really nice youtube series on React done by Web Dev Simplified. I honestly can't tell if a lot of the things covered will be stuff I would utilize for this particular site, but for the most part all the videos are 10-20 minutes long and he does them in a "follow along" style. There is a big part of me that thinks a more basic html/javascript site could handle what I will end up making, but I really want to use React so that's what I'm going with. Not sure why I thought I would use C# for the backend, but I can't see that being the case at this point. I did also tinker with a drawio but did not get too far. I feel like I'm further along than it actually appears. 

12/3 Lunch commit notes -- In the process of sorting through hand written notes. I already had a dummy site set up and... it's all gone. So this is a new site *linked properly this time* to the repository I'll be using going forward. Still have a fair amount to go over with my friend and then it will be even more writing things down by hand followed by typing them into the computer, but I do think we have a solid framework to build with. My previous layout iteration was better than the one below, but this is the rough concept/MVP. And I probably will ultimately go with the alternative style because I think it will end up being more clean and it will also showcase his actual games more specifically. He MAY also have a lead on an API which would expand the site considerably. If it comes down to my personally making one, I probably won't take a serious look at implimenting one until we cover APIs in two weeks.

Friday 12/10:

9:30am -- 11am. WIP commit. Found some resources for creating custom shaped links/buttons. Will be vital for how users interact with the site.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Shapes

12:30 WIP commit. Created GameDetail and started working on CabinetControl, but stopped so I could grab lunch. 

3:00 WIP commit. Solved a naming issue within App.js (explained the localhost:3000 title I kept seeing). At a bit of an impasse on the project though. I'm leaning towards just hardcoding the games and focusing on their display as opposed to having full CRUD to add/edit/delete any of them. Also nowhere near figuring out how to merge custom link shapes onto the page. I did have the site compiling and showing the Header for a bit so I know that is hooked up correctly, but I don't have a Games.js and subsequently no Game function so the propTypes I'm referencing in GameDetail will keep coming back undefined until I do.
