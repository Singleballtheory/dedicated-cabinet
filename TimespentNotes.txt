12/21:
Started just before 8am. 

10am WIP comments. Still getting nowhere. I think I am simply going to move forward and see if I can get the render to work by referencing my rootdown project because I know that had a hard-coded drink list. Stay tuned.

WIP
I Broke at 2pm on Friday for lunch and then had an unforeseen circumstance come up so I have to get a couple more hours in today.

Started at 1pm. Filled out remainder of gameInfo. Believe it will be better to store this all in it's own file and export it in, but for now it's in GameList. Also, still doesn't load properly. Hence the WIP. Want to get this commit in before I do something bad though.

4:25 WIP Commit. Still not getting the hardcoded tickets to render. I've gone back through the React Fundamentals section trying to figure out where my code is failing. At this point I just need to get my MVP working. I think perhaps the issue is that I have pieces of code that are further along in the React coursework and because I can't see where I've advanced ahead, that's why I can't see the issue. Most of the time it's not even throwing an error and compiles just fine. In it's current state however it is saying game.name in GameDetail is undefined. Prior attempts however it simply rendered the Header and NavBar but nothing else.

9:30 WIP commit. Trying to make a nice header with css styling, but is not going so well. Went to a place www.canva.com and it kind of feels like I can get a bit more of what I want by creating the entire header there and then importing it as an image.

11:30 UPDATE:  This took forever and it's still not quite what I want (png instead of running with animations, etc) BUT I have a reasonably decent looking header now and it's actually displaying!

1:45 and 2:00 UDATE: Way past time for lunch so I'm giving up for now. Been trying to get the GameList function to build correctly. Finally made a commit that I know doesn't work, but then forgot I had erased the dummy GameList info I was trying to display in the first place so added that back in. Still doesn't work, but hopefully makes it a bit more clear what I was trying to get to display.

Friday 12/10:

9:30am -- 11am. WIP commit. Found some resources for creating custom shaped links/buttons. Will be vital for how users interact with the site.

https://travishorn.com/buttons-with-custom-shapes-cabdcde7dfd1
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Shapes

12:30 WIP commit. Created GameDetail and started working on CabinetControl, but stopped so I could grab lunch.

3:00 WIP commit. Solved a naming issue within App.js (explained the localhost:3000 title I kept seeing). At a bit of an impasse on the project though. I'm leaning towards just hardcoding the games and focusing on their display as opposed to having full CRUD to add/edit/delete any of them. Also nowhere near figuring out how to merge custom link shapes onto the page. I did have the site compiling and showing the Header for a bit so I know that is hooked up correctly, but I don't have a Games.js and subsequently no Game function so the propTypes I'm referencing in GameDetail will keep coming back undefined until I do.


4:30 WIP commit. Got the informational aspects narrowed down and display intentions finalized. Friend/client likes the concept of having smaller tooltip display when mousing over each cabinet and then clicking on the cabinet to see full details, images, description, etc. Was worried I wouldn't have enough to justify making a website, now concerned I have way too much. Below is the information for each game he owns. I have to decide if I still just want to store this data locally or create full CRUD to add the data in via the app itself and use Firestore. Would also need authentication as well most likely.

12/3 End of day notes -- Had a bit of a hickup with the friend I'm building this for. He wasn't available this afternoon to go over thoughts/ideas/desires for the site so I've more or less just been watching videos and looking stuff up. I found a really nice youtube series on React done by Web Dev Simplified. I honestly can't tell if a lot of the things covered will be stuff I would utilize for this particular site, but for the most part all the videos are 10-20 minutes long and he does them in a "follow along" style. There is a big part of me that thinks a more basic html/javascript site could handle what I will end up making, but I really want to use React so that's what I'm going with. Not sure why I thought I would use C# for the backend, but I can't see that being the case at this point. I did also tinker with a drawio but did not get too far. I feel like I'm further along than it actually appears. 

12/3 Lunch commit notes -- In the process of sorting through hand written notes. I already had a dummy site set up and... it's all gone. So this is a new site *linked properly this time* to the repository I'll be using going forward. Still have a fair amount to go over with my friend and then it will be even more writing things down by hand followed by typing them into the computer, but I do think we have a solid framework to build with. My previous layout iteration was better than the one below, but this is the rough concept/MVP. And I probably will ultimately go with the alternative style because I think it will end up being more clean and it will also showcase his actual games more specifically. He MAY also have a lead on an API which would expand the site considerably. If it comes down to my personally making one, I probably won't take a serious look at implimenting one until we cover APIs in two weeks.

https://mui.com/ -- A React UI library. Has TONS of stuff in it. Spent a lot of time here Note, I have not installed this yet, but based upon all the available styling options in here I'm pretty certain it has everything I will need to get the site looking how I want it.  -- 2 hours
